# Machine Learning and Data Mining Project
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to build a predictive model using real-world data.

The focus was on understanding the full process of model development: from data processing and analysis to model selection, evaluation, and interpretation.

The dataset used in this project was the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains 303 instances and 14 attributes. The goal was to predict the
presence of heart disease based on a set of clinical and demographic features.

The project was implemented in Python using libraries such as scikitlearn, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow and others.
Throughout the project, key challenges such as handling of missing or ordial data, visualisation of data and evaluating model performance were addressed. 
The models' performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
